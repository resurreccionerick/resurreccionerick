# About Me

Hi! I'm Erick Resurreccion, and I love making mobile apps. It's not just a job to me; it's what I'm passionate about. I've spent a lot of time learning how to create awesome mobile experiences that really make a difference.

## ðŸ“± Mobile App Developer || Software Engineer

I'm really passionate about creating mobile apps that people love to use. I've explored different ways of building apps to make sure they're the best they can be. Although I've tried cross-platform development with React Native, I'm most skilled at making apps for Android Apps.

### Expertise Overview:

- **Native Android Development**: My forte lies in native Android development, where I leverage architectural patterns such as MVP (Model-View-Presenter) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel). With a strong foundation in Java and ongoing transition to Kotlin, I focus on crafting robust and efficient Android applications. Embracing Kotlin as a modern language aligns with industry trends, enhancing my development capabilities and ensuring I stay ahead in this dynamic field.

- **Cross-Platform Development**: Experienced in utilizing React Native to build versatile mobile applications compatible with both iOS and Android platforms. This approach streamlines development processes, facilitating broader audience reach.
